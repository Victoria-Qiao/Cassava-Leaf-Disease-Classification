# Cassava-Leaf-Disease-Classification
Code and report of a Kaggle competition - Cassava Leaf Disease Classification

Cassava, which is a popular kind of crop in Africa. It could be used in many areas and withstand harsh farming conditions. However, there are some types of diseases that make poor harvest. To cope with this problem, we need to identify the type of cassava disease and remedy it. Nowadays, image classification techniques could be applied to help identify cassava disease. Recently, us- ing image classification to detect cassava disease has been attached great importance as a Kag- gle competition. We selected this topic as our project, in which, firstly we tried several com- mon single-type deep neural networks including ResNet, DenseNet, ResNext, EfficientNet B3 and Vision Transformer. Then based on their perfor- mance, we did ensembling classification using models with the top three highest validation ac- curacy. It shows that ensembling model performs much better than single-type models. Based on the ensembling model, we also investigated sev- eral generalization and regularization methods in- cluding Fmix, however, experiment results show that these methods fail to improve the validation performance.
